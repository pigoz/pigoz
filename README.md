I'm a software developer based in Italy. I like Ruby, TypeScript and functional
programming. A retired maintainer of [mpv](https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv), I'm
currently spending a lot of my free time trying to learn Japanese (with terrible
results) and writing free software to automate and optimize language learning.
