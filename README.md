### Hello,

I'm a software developer based in Italy🇮🇹.

Project co-founder and former maintainer at [mpv](https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv). I ♥️ Ruby, TypeScript, functional programming, and have gotten into [Effect](https://github.com/Effect-TS) lately.

I like hiking and climbing. In Italy these are not "tech-bro" hobbies, and I never had boba before 🙂
