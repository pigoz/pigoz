### Hello,

I'm a software developer based in Italy.

I like Ruby, TypeScript, functional
programming, and have gotten into  [effect-ts](https://github.com/Effect-TS) lately.

Project co-founder and former maintainer at [mpv](https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv). Used to do a lot of open source, but I now spend most of my free time hiking or climbing.
